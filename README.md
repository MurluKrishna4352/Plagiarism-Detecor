# 📝 Plagiarism Detection Tool

## 📖 Overview
This project provides a tool to detect plagiarism between two text files. The program reads the contents of the files, processes the text, and computes a similarity score to identify potential plagiarism. The results are visualized in a heatmap, showing the percentage of plagiarism detected.

## ✨ Features
- 🛠️ **Text Preprocessing:** Handles text normalization (e.g., case folding, removing punctuation) to ensure accurate similarity computation.
- 📊 **Similarity Measurement:** Computes similarity using vector operations, providing a reliable measure of text overlap.
- 🎨 **Visualization:** Generates a heatmap to visually represent the percentage of plagiarism.

## 🚀 Usage
1. 📂 Place the two text files to be compared in the project directory.
2. 📝 Modify the code to specify the file names or paths of the text files.
3. ▶️ Run the notebook to execute the detection and view the results.
4. 🌡️ The heatmap visualizing the plagiarism percentage will be displayed.

## 📊 Example Output
A heatmap is generated where:
- Each cell represents the similarity score between sections of the two texts.
- Darker colors indicate higher percentages of plagiarism.

## 📝 Notes
- The tool is designed for educational purposes and is suitable for comparing small to medium-sized text files.
- For larger datasets or detailed reports, additional optimizations or more advanced algorithms may be required.
